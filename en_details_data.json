              "Placements": "In Civil Engineering, around 70-80% of students get placed, which is pretty good. Highest package offered so far is about 31 LPA (Lacs per annum), while the lowest is around 3 LPA. On average, students get 5 LPA. When it comes to internships, more than 90% of students manage to land one. Main roles offered include Site Engineer, Structural Engineer, Project Manager, and others related to construction and infrastructure.",
              "Infrastructure": "Infrastructure and facilities at our university are really good. There's Wi-Fi throughout the campus, the classrooms are well-organized, and the library is great with strong internet connectivity. Mess food is actually better than most private universities, though it's purely vegetarian.",
              "Faculty": "Faculty is supportive and well-qualified. They explain things from the basics, and they're always ready to help if you have doubts. They also have a good understanding of the subjects and teach based on industry requirements, so you get to learn the relevant tools and technologies used in the field. The course curriculum is up-to-date and matches well with what's needed in the industry. Semesters are manageable. It's not too hard to pass, but if you want a high CGPA, you'll need to put in some extra effort."

Top recruiting companies are Amazon and Mahindra. The top 10 students in each course with a good percentage in main or semester exams get Rs.100000 scholarship. Internship is not provided by the college in 2nd and 3rd years. So many students do private internships. The internships for our course are machine learning, data analyst, data science, and software.",

We have a clinic for medical situations and ambulance in case of emergencies. The hostel room is shared by only 2 people with attached bathroom for girls and common washroom for boys. The food and security is very good. We have various indoor and outdoor sports such as football, tennis, cricket, badminton, volleyball, etc.",

Sometimes, you may be disappointed with the faculty. The teaching quality is above average. The course is relevant to the BSE computer and maths integrated course provided in many IITs and NITs. We have 7-10 subjects per semester on average. The exams are on a quite difficult level. The pass percentage is 85%.",
              "Other": "Our course gives me the opportunity to choose both computers, maths, and data science as my main stream. The best thing about my course is the lab work and the subject knowledge they provide. I wish the number of subjects to be reduced to a maximum of 6 so that I can concentrate on other activities or external courses. We have multiple events per academic year like sports event, cultural event, annual event, and entrepreneur events."

The benches are not sufficient for everyone; if all students attend on the same day, half of them will not get a seat. The Wi-Fi is non-existent and never works. Labs are similarly just for namesake; in computer labs, many computers do not work, and in the chemistry lab, you will only be given a few experiments to perform, and typically just one reading, merely to show that you have done something. There is no good canteen, and the sports facilities are lacking.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are helpful, and all are assistant professors. They are somewhat knowledgeable but provide average teaching, so do not expect a lot; a few teachers are great. Don’t rely on the course curriculum, as it is cut short, and DSA is taught not practically but through rote learning. Nothing in the course will make you industry-ready. There are many exams; you will first take 2 sessionals within a one-month gap, a viva in between, and then a week of final viva and final exams. There is no time for any self-study. To pass, you need 40 percent in total.",
              "Other": "I chose this college because I thought it was close to my home and that I could study DSA on my own. Now that I know there is no free time, if there were fewer exams, we would have more time for important things. There are many small events, but no one is interested in them in the hot weather of Faridabad. Sometimes there are fests, but they occur on extremely hot days, and usually outside. There is nothing on campus, although there is a Suraj Kund Mela nearby around February. The nearest metro station is 20 minutes."

There are so many opportunities for internships if you have good skills compared to other students, and also have a decent CG, at least above 8.5.

As in 1st year, all students have a common syllabus across all their respective branches, but I don't understand why a computer science student should learn about graphics.",

The course curriculum is relevant if you are not interested in this subject, but after admission, you gain much interest in the subjects, and the labs are very interesting. If you work hard, you are industry-ready. The semester exam is not that difficult if you study well, you can pass the exam very easily. The pass percentage in my department is 99%.",

As the campus has recently shifted, these fest don't meet most of the students expectations. The college provides information about various scholarships; all we need to do is be active. The major drawback of this college is connectivity. If you need to buy anything, most of the time you need to go to Itanagar. There are only two buses to Itanagar, and the timings are bad. There are no buses in college. So while going to classes, you will be walking down the hill. On Sunday, there is no transport. As of now, we can say that connectivity is the worst."

We have more than enough Wi-Fi routers right in front of our room and in every building. We have all types of labs for all branches of students, and we have a proper library having all books that are required.\nThe best part is single rooms in hostels.",

If we study what all the teachers teach, then we can easily score, and they also ask us to refer to some books for our betterment.\nThe pass percentage is 50% relatively, or 5 CGPA in every subject and lab.",
              "Other": "I choose ECE electronics and communication as it's an exploring field, a hill branch, as a senior told me before coming here, and having mostly the highest package on the campus\nThere are a lot of events and fests.

The roles offered for my course are mostly software developers, as many students prepare for that. Other than that, roles like VLSI engineers are also offered.",
              "Infrastructure": "After switching to the new permanent campus, the infrastructure is top-notch. We have a huge library, department blocks, teaching block, ground, etc. The mess is within hostels. The only drawback is the boys hostel is around a km away from the teaching block, although it's within campus. Therefore, having a bicycle is recommended.",
              "Faculty": "The teachers are all from different IITs and abroad universities, but the course till my year was outdated; with the implementation of the New Education Policy, it changed, and now the course and curriculum are comparatively better. The exams are really difficult, but relatively grading helps score a good CGPA. The continuous evaluation means you'll be having some sort of minor or assignment always.",
              "Other": "I chose ECE because it is considered one of the evergreen courses. The choice was correct, as you get the opportunity to sit in almost the same companies as CSE plus companies specific to ECE. So go for it, but keep in mind that the academics for ECE and software skills for CSE have to be balanced, which makes you exhausted."

              "Faculty": "Teachers are very helpful, at least in the core branches. There is not much knowledge about non-core branches. The curriculum is well defined and is suited for competitive exams. Pass percentage every year is 90%+. So overall, all semesters are difficult; even just 3rd year maybe a bit challenging due to tight schedule of curriculum\n.",

So, due to pandemic factors, I decided to take admission at NIT Goa. I was getting CSE in NIT Goa so I decided it was better to take the best possible branch if I was going to stay in Goa itself. I would like a dedicated high-end lab in our college, at least for the core branches, where they could explore high-end technologies. The environment is very good. The climate is very good. The campus is very close to a major city. The institute provides internships at the National Institute of Oceanography as summer interns to academically excellent students. The curriculum is a bit strict so it's sometimes difficult to do part-time freelancing."

Compared to last year, when all the CSE students were placed by now, and some had multiple offers this year, the count is low. For the ECE branch, the situation seems better placement wise but the EEE branch has been hit really hard. Hardly any students have been placed, and a lot of oversight takes place as companies naturally tend to ignore students from the EEE branch and focus on the CSE branch even when there are students with a lot of experience in web development and machine learning.",
              "Infrastructure": "As the current campus is our transmit campus, we have limited infrastructure and hostel facilities. I would have been happy to write this review after about one month, as we are shifting to our permanent campus on January 7, 2024. The infrastructure there and the hostel facilities are more than enough to raise our ranking.",
              "Faculty": "The faculty, as in every college, is strict and firm as far as the syllabus is concerned. Give them a chance and they will show you their soft sides, which you would not have expected. When it comes to exams, each faculty member has their own method; some have a strict teaching style and an innovative questioning style, while others follow the standard NPETL style of teaching but provide tough questions with an easy correction level. Attendance is very strictly maintained and I might say that is the only thing making us pay attention these days in class.",
              "Other": "Crowding and campus life are two separate things. The crowd, as in the students, hails from various parts of India and we managed to have a last in our transmit campus. Being a small campus, fests and events were always limited in number but after COVID, we never made a comeback in the events department. Though we have many lines for our new campus, I hope to see y'all there. When it comes to the branch I have opted for and the value for money, I was more interested in IT subjects. Believe me when I say that and not just because everyone these days likes IT branches. But even the EEE branch has been quite interesting to me. Students who have an actual liking for the subject might definitely like the branch and the course overall."

This is the major lag of this college. Talking about classrooms, the size is small and not well-equipped even just feels like average sitting there. Labs are good and well-equipped. Professors guide us nicely there. Hostels are average. You will get basic facilities of course. But didn't expect much. The mess is average. We can survive with it. But this is how things are practically.",

The courses are kept updated always depending on the market trends and requirements. College exams are neither too easy nor that difficult to ace one can crack them if he/she studies sincerely. There are few students who get a back. So you have to be kind and sincere.",

Most teachers preferred to take classes using the SMART board and avoided using blackboards. Some of them simply read the textbooks and moved on."

Though, unlike many other NITs, in the second semester, every branch gets a unique exclusive subject and practical subject. The curriculum is good and relevant. Exams aren’t that tough.

Top recruiting companies for mechanical are:\nBosch, Tata Motors, Adani, Reliance, Torrent, Power, Tata Power, Mahindra, Amazon, Google, TCS, etc. The roles offered in our college are in IT companies; mostly the roles are managerial roles to lead the team. In power sector and energy sector, mainly the roles of engineer is to design and improve the performance and efficiency of machines. In the manufacturing industry, it is to see and lead the workers and to apply cost-cutting operations. The internships are offered after 6 semesters at the college. Currently, I am studying in the 5th semester, so I have not much idea about it. But companies like ISRO, Adani, BIS, etc. give the projects and internship very much to NIRMA UNIVERSITY. Currently I am also working on project funded by BIS (bureau of Indian standards) in which I have to analyze the design and strength of materials used in transmission lies.",

In the hostel, the basic facilities were given, like bed, AC, tables and washrooms, induction, fridge, etc. The quality of food in mess and canteen is average only. Once my friend got food poisoning also eating food of mess, so hygiene wise it is poor.",
              "Faculty": "Most of the teachers are not at all friendly and they also do not have much knowledge, They only know how to shoot and sell at the students and not know how to teach the subject. Also, the head and teachers will not understand the problems of the students and the new rules made in college are always in the benefit of faculty only. The course curriculum is relevant as we are learning all the core subjects of mechanical. Also, there is a facility to opt for minors, so you can also learn CS law and management subjects even if you are doing mechanical. Yes, there is always a barrier between theoretical engineering and practical engineering, but it is reduced somehow by students of GTU colleges. The end-of-semester exams are moderate, out of which 70% paper is always easy and rest 30% is always difficult, thus you can easily score at least 50-60 marks and get passed. The pass ratio is 85%, so 10–15 students fail the end-of-semester exams and have to give a supplementary exam.",
              "Other": "The best things about mechanical is that it is easy and once you know the concepts, you can clear it. Also, manufacturing is more practical and needed in every sector. The main thing all engineers love of mechanical is designing the component and Thermodynamics. Now a days you can analyse where your component will be failing and the critical points using FEA and computational fluid dynamics. Things I wish to get improved are that instead of learning all department subjects in the first year, rather software like SolidWorks, CATIA, and Ansys should be taught in the first year more deeply. Events in Nirma are held most from Jan to April. Main events are vaudeville, ashwamedha, praveg, Kalp, etc. Campus is big and lush green campus. The public coming to Nirma is decent and coming from well-settled families. There are two main scholarships, MYSY and NIRMA SCHOLARSHIP SCHEME; more details you will get on website about it."

The course is relevant in context to the curriculum, but it doesn’t make students quite ready for anything. I feel like I have to forcibly learn the things. Semester exams are easy, but the checking is difficult.",

The pass percentage is good, as our college has an average grading system.",

The only thing that should be improved is the syllabus, which should be more modern, needs-oriented subjects, such as Engineering Drawing, should not be that important for CS students. Overall, our course is good. There are no big fests in our college, but still, programs by cultural clubs are good. Connectivity is good, with bus service available for visiting the city. The surroundings are beautiful and full of greenery. Scholarship is provided to minority caste students and merit-based scholarships."

Also in my course there are a lot of classes in the second year as compared to other courses;if the classes are less it will be better and the facilities in the lab also should improve. In this college there will be many fests as there are many cultural clubs available in the campus. But the fests will be very small compared to the fests in IITs. The Campus Crowd is very good and the connectivity is very nice among the students here, but the campus surrounding is not nice as the campus is located on top of a hill and in the middle of a forest;you have to travel 10 kms to reach the city."

              "Placements": "The placement percentage is probably around 60% owing to the fact that the majority of IT companies are not hiring right now. However, in a normal year, this percentage can go up to 75%. The highest package is around the 50 lac range most years, and the lowest is 4 LPA. The average hovers around 11-12 LPA. Top recruiting companies are Zomato, Google. Around 20% of students get internships, and Swiggy, Nokia, JP Morgan, and Accenture are some of the companies that provide internships.",
              "Infrastructure": "The hostel is pretty good, food is above average with good Wi-Fi connectivity. Classrooms are spacious with smart TVs, which are used by the teachers. The library is very well-equipped too, with charging ports on every table, and books from all topics, irrespective of whether it's in the curriculum or not, are available. Food is above average in the mess, and canteen food is very good but paid. Medical facilities are below par as there is only a single doctor on campus who isn't present all the time. Sports facilities are top-notch, with basketball courts, a football turf, a badminton court, and a gymnasium as well.",
              "Faculty": "Faculty members are 50/50 to be very honest. Some are exceptional while others are mediocre. However, the majority of the faculty members are very qualified and helpful as well. The course curriculum is updated every 2 years, so it is highly relevant. The semester exams are moderate to slightly difficult. The pass percentage is very high though, 95%+."

They said the hostel facilities are good and the food is better than the food provided in PGs, to the point at which my friends who stay in PGs come to the college mess to have food. Wi-Fi and classrooms are amazing on the Ring Road campus, and in the city, it's not bad, but it's not comparable to the Ring Road campus.",
              "Faculty": "The faculty is well-trained and knowledgeable. They know what they are talking about, and if you are a keen learner, they can help you beyond what students can even imagine. The college is very much into making industry-ready students who are ready to face the challenges, through the means of making the students write research papers, perform case studies, and they have worksheets which help the students get an insight into the problems faced in the industry. The exams are pretty simple for the BBA program, and there is not much to worry about, although you cannot just walk in and get good marks. Pay attention in class and read the notes, and you are good to go.",
              "Other": "BBA is a simple course, yet the main objective of choosing BBA was to get a chance to make connections and learn the dos and don'ts of the business world. I feel there is a need to be a little more practical as to how the courses' teaching could benefit us in real life and try to foster and build creativity through the means of activities and projects, which will also help build our CVs. The top 5 percent of the students get a 50% reduced tuition fee as a scholarship. The next 10% get a 40% fee reduction. You can choose to join various extracurricular activities; both indoor and outdoor activities are available to a good extent, with the facilities being some of the best I've witnessed."

Since it is a college that started just 8 years ago. There are only a limited amount of courses, and the campus is small. But recently the intake was pretty much high, and it is crowded a bit. There are extracurricular activities that you could do here. But the thing is, you have to learn how to manage the academics and extracurricular activities, and then you are good to go.

Hostels are average but quite costly compared to other NITs. The mess is decent, and there is no hostel canteen.

Top companies like Oracle, Apple, American Express, and Nvidia have also visited the campus. Some of our 3rd-year seniors have even bagged internships in companies like Texas Instruments and Flipkart. Some have also bagged PPOs in top startups like PhonePe. Companies like JPMorgan and Microsoft also visit the campus in their placement grounds every year. The placements in electrical are really good, with previous years seeing 52 LPA, the highest package in electrical, with a median of around 12 LPA and an average of around 13 LPA.",
              "Infrastructure": "The infrastructure can surely be better. However, it is still manageable, with labs being allotted for every course. We have regular lab classes, promoting hands-on learning. The food quality is okay, and the hostel is also okay. Sports facilities are really good, with football, cricket, volleyball, basketball, lawn tennis, and badminton courts. It also has a great gym. I would say that PEC Chandigarh has a really good atmosphere.",
              "Faculty": "The teachers are all Ph.D. scholars. They have great experience. They are extremely knowledgeable. The teaching quality was pretty good for the most part, with some classes being pretty boring, just like any other engineering college. The course curriculum is relevant enough, and it is evident if we look at the placements. It surely makes the students industry-ready. The semester exams are pretty conceptual. They are not tough, but they can only be solved by people who have really understood the concepts.",
              "Other": "I chose this course because I liked Physics and math. The electrical Engineering has a lot of that. This course is evergreen, yet quite challenging. It is never going to die. I would like the course to be a little more up-to-date. The events and fests are really good. Top singers like Sunidhi Chauhan and Asees Kaur have performed at PEC Chandigarh in the past."

The washrooms are average and need frequent maintenance. The mess food is edible but monotonous.",
              "Faculty": "The faculty at PEC is a mixed bag, some senior professors are absolute gems with deep knowledge in the core and CSE departments but a few others just stick to slides. You can't rely entirely on classroom teaching, most of us end up studying from YouTube or reference books. The curriculum has been updated recently to include some modern electives, but for placement you need to put extra effort outside the syllabus to be truly industry-ready. As for exams PEC follows a relative grading system which is a blessing and a curse.",
              "Other": "I chose PEC primarily for its legacy (more than 100 years old)and its prime location in Chandigarh. The best thing about the course is the flexible academic culture, unlike strict private colleges we get enough time to work on personal skills, coding, or startups. The alumni network is massive and very helpful. The infrastructure needs a serious upgrade, some hostel buildings, Shivalik, are very old, and hygiene can be an issue. I also wish the curriculum were updated faster to include modern tech stacks. Pecfest is the heart of our college life."

              "Placements": "I am in Computer Science branch, currently in 1st year, and currently we have achieved 90 percent placements in our branch. The highest package this year is around 53 LPA, average is around 16 LPA, and the lowest is between 5 to 6 LPA. One of the top recruiting companies this time is JP Morgan. Top roles such as SDE are offered by the companies.",
              "Infrastructure": "College has poor infrastructure, especially Shivalik hostel. Wi-Fi in the classrooms is very slow and jammers are installed in the classrooms. Library is well maintained and large enough for the students to study there with proper facilities like AC, charging ports, and good internet connectivity. College has all types of labs required for the course. College has many grounds for different sports, a swimming pool, and a gymnasium. For medical facilities, we have a dispensary inside the campus. Food quality of mess is average and of canteen is good.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are helpful and qualified enough, but they don't teach so deeply in the first year as the subjects in first year are not related to core. So, even students don't care much about those subjects. The course is relevant and makes the students industry ready. Semester exams are doable as far as difficult is concerned. There is relative grading, which makes scoring a CG like 9 competitive.",
              "Other": "Scholarships are only available for those who belong to a family whose annual income is very less. Computer Science is the best course in this college than any other branch as far as placements are concerned. This year's fest is very average as the main event got cancelled due to some issues with the management. Overall, hostel life and campus are very enjoyable. Clubs are active, so there is no dearth of extra-curricular activities in campus."

Many top recruiting companies visited my college, such as Johnson and Johnson, Bharat Tech, and many more. Almost in every sem, students get internship opportunities easily from my branch. Top roles offered are designing or researching bio related things, and also some opt out for higher studies. This is possible because my college is number one in the COMEDK colleges list.",

Library is also there with a vast variety of books and articles. My college has accommodation for both boys and girls on campus, in which rooms can be double, triple, or even more sharing options are available. There is a common mess for all branch students, which is quite good in taste.",
              "Faculty": "Medical facilities is there in my college with a ambulance available for 24hrs and all types of sports activities also happens there such as indoor outdoor as well as gym is also installed their. The teachers in my college are very helpful in nature and have higher knowledge in their respective fields with higher degrees. The course is more than sufficient for the students who want to contribute to biotech, and the exams are above average, but you need to study at least 10 days before the exam, as it is RVCE, and 80 to 90% get passed.",
              "Other": "I chose this course because my college is one of the top 1 colleges of COMEDK, which will provide a better infrastructure and resources. The best things about my course are that I can learn all the main points of engineering with the help of my faculty members. Events in my college are many, such as 8th Mile, technical events, cultural events, CARV, QuizCorp, and many more. Campus crowd is good, and the connection is also good with big colleges. Scholarship is there for needy students, and the campus is very well maintained and good enough for each and every student."

Semester exams are of average level, and around 90% of students easily passed.",

RVCE is a brand, and every year, more than 100 companies visit the campus to hire resources. Internships and jobs are available, and the reason these students got placed was that they actually had some relevant skills and showed up in interviews conducted during campus drives. Good companies like L&T, Tech Mahindra, Geodesic, TCS, Infosys, Amazon, HDFC, ICICI, etc., were the top recruiters. The minimum package is from 3.5 LPA, and the maximum is 7 LPA.",

All festivals are celebrated in the hostels. Full freedom is given to students for good activities.",

Every student is required to complete one project per semester, which is a non-academic project. These projects need to be done following software development life cycle techniques. Every semester, in every course, there are at least two labs a week, and they are conducted strictly according to the timetable. Exams called Internals are conducted in the second, third, and fourth months of every semester, and the semester end exams are conducted at the end."

The quality of food in the mess and canteen is good as compared to the other colleges so in the food area you won't have many complaints.",

Many companies come to collaborate with professionals and other teachers and give them projects then the professors and other teachers choose the students to work with them on the project so the opportunities here are good. The curriculum is the same as that of the other colleges so it's not that different. Semester exams are not that difficult but still, you have to study well to score well.",
              "Other": "One of the most shocks that I got after joining the college was that it's getting under-constructed and that here there is an EL thing which is experiential learning where you have to meet teams with your friends or other branch members. They have to work on a model or prototype that solves any world problem they take it very seriously. You will be awarded marks for this and this is as important as your internal marks so if you plan on coming to RV remember to make a team in the starting stages only."

The library will allow issuing maximum 3 books at a time, and you can issue it to maximum 1 week which result in constant reissuing every week + failure to do so have to pay Rs. 5 a day fine.

There are no very big names among the companies (on-campus), and the top ones are TCS & Infosys. Most students got internships, including many completing their 1st year. Top roles are related to SDE, Data Science, and AI.",
              "Infrastructure": "The library is pretty big and useful, with a huge set of books. Wi-Fi is amazing (hostel excluded). You'll find exceptions even on roads while you are walking on campus. Classrooms & labs for this course in the AI building are unarguably one of the best in the country, not exaggerating. Hostel rooms are comparable to the ones from dorms of international universities, with the option of attached washrooms too. Even common washrooms are clean all the time as they're thoroughly cleaned several times throughout the day. Mess is pretty, and food is decent too. We have to pay extra for non-vegetarian food.",
              "Faculty": "Most teachers are helpful, qualified, and knowledgeable. Teaching quality is mediocre, though some are great, and some are just pathetic. Curriculum is 100% relevant, and not a single subject is useless. If you decide to study sincerely according to the curriculum, you'll be more than ready for jobs. Semester exams are online and fairly very easy, which is a con for me, as most people secure more than 8CGPA. Pass percentage is over 95%.",
              "Other": "B.Tech CSE courses and most other courses, in fact, have a very relevant curriculum to today's industries & development. Things that can be improved, though, are some teachers and exam methods. The campus is one of the cleanest in the country, absolutely gorgeous. There is a lot of scope for every type of extracurricular activity. Scholarships are good, with unique ones like the single parents' scholarship. There are several events & fests. Honesty, you most likely won't even go to half of them after 2 months, but it's a good thing, it brings a lot of opportunities."

The semester exams are of a moderate level, which can be easily cracked, and 9 to 10 students fail.",
              "Other": "I have chosen this course because SIT has a good placement record for many years in branches like CSE, ECE, and AIML. The best things about this course are that it has well-equipped labs, supportive teachers, and a peaceful campus environment. I think a greater variety of food should be available at mess and make some growth in the placement of lower branches, like mechanical, civil, and many more. There is a cultural fest named Sanskriti and a tech fest named Kalashree, and department-level events are vibrant. Campus crowd is very friendly and diverse. Connectivity is well-connected to Tumkur city, buses and autos are available."

            "detailed_review": {
              "Placements": "I'm currently studying B.Tech in AI, and till now, no batch has passed out yet for this course. The first batch will be passing out in 2025. But for other branches of B.Tech, I would say that the placements are below average. In 2023, the median package was 6 LPA and the highest was 12 LPA. Considering fees and other expenses, this is definitely a bad ROI. This year, I got to know from my seniors that companies like TCS have tests with 4 levels, and your salary is decided based on how many levels you clear. For clearing level 1, it is 4 LPA, level 2 is 5-7 LPA, level 3 is 7-9 LPA, and level 4 is 10/10+ LPA. After the tests, there is an interview, where they will decide the final salary from the range in which you have landed after the tests. Mostly all the companies that go to B.Tech colleges come here for placements as well, like TCS, Accenture, etc.",
              "Infrastructure": "The first thing I would like to say is that the campus is SMALL. It is smaller than my school's campus, and there are no sports facilities. It is just one average-sized building. Given that, if you are okay with a smaller campus, then the college won't be a problem, as the building does have good infrastructure. For example, it is fully air-conditioned, and yes, the ACs do work properly. The labs are very good and equipped with the best gear. The lifts function well, and there are enough lifts. Wi-Fi is available, but it doesn't really work except in the library. The classrooms are good and comfortable. The washrooms are clean. The library has a good amount of study material and is a good place to study as well. The canteen is pretty good as well; there are a ton of things to choose from, and the rates are pretty reasonable. The taste is also good. They do provide a hostel, but it is off-campus, and I haven't heard good things about the hostel either. The rooms are decent but overpriced: 3.3 LPA if you want an AC room and around 3 LPA for a non-AC room. So, it is better to rent a flat or stay in a PG nearby.",
              "Faculty": "The teachers here are definitely very good and helpful. Of course, if you don't have a good relationship with them, then that's probably your fault. They are highly qualified individuals and very knowledgeable. Most of my teachers this semester were IIT graduates. The teaching quality is good, and the teachers will help you out whenever you need it. The course has changed a little from this year due to NEP, and it has definitely improved now. We get to learn a wide variety of subjects which will help us shape ourselves in the longer run (though we hate them right now because we have to study more subjects than earlier batches). If the student is following the curriculum, studying regularly, and completing all the assignments and projects, then I can say that the student will be fairly ready for the industry. We have 3 exams during a semester: 2 midterms (10/20 marks each) and a term-end exam (100 marks). The midterms were a breeze, but the term-end exams are definitely on the tougher side. YOU WILL HAVE TO STUDY HARD FOR THE TERM ENDS, or else you might not even pass. For instance, more than half of my class is failing calculus this semester. And no, you cannot cheat; the monitoring is very strict in the term-end exams. You'll be lucky if you get to cheat without getting caught.",
              "Other": "The events and fests are mid-level. Since the campus is small, there is very little space for events and fests. They aren't bad, but I've definitely seen better events and fests being hosted by other colleges. The crowd is good and diverse, as there are students from a lot of courses in the same building, so you can connect with people from different fields and courses easily."

From gym area, music area and library to multiple computer labs, Wi-Fi and centrally air conditioned campus and a lavish canteen, the campus is a student's dream.",

It also allows me to get a B.Tech and MBA from NMIMS in 5 years, which is a year less than the actual time a 4 year B.Tech and 2 Year MBA takes. I am being taught basics of accounting right from the start of 2nd year, which is a great thing and helps me build my base. The campus has a nice crowd and events and fests are a sight to behold."

The library has all the books that are recommended by the teacher. Hostel is also good. One thing I can say is that the food is good and cooked with hygiene.",

The minimum package is 3 LPA, and the highest package is 10 LPA. 80% of students got their internship at Infosys. Our top recruiters are Infosys, Deloitte, and ISRO.",
              "Infrastructure": "The infrastructure is very good, and it's developing too. The library and Wi-Fi are very good. The hostel food is superb, and the hostel environment is too good. In summer, it may have some electricity problems for just 1 or 2 hours. They conduct cricket matches every month, and there are sports meets where we have many opportunities to reach the state level or national level.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are very helpful in preparing us for our placements and also for the GATE examination. The teaching of the syllabus is very good. The curriculum is relevant to the present generation, but we as students must prepare ourselves for industry purposes. They only teach the subject, not all other things."

Recruiting companies like TCS, Infosys, Google, Accenture, and Cognizant are the companies for my course. Software development roles, IT services, data analysis, data scientist, web development, and software testing roles are offered in my course.",

The hostel does not have Wi-Fi, and the mess is run by the students. The food is sometimes good, but sometimes it is the worst. The college has a health center with a doctor, nurse, and medicine. There is a large ground on campus where an indoor stadium is planned.",
              "Faculty": "The faculty in my course were qualified and knowledgeable. Some of them were very student-friendly. They would teach part of a topic, and we were expected to learn the rest on our own in preparation for industry. Semester exams were easy for those who were in good with the faculty. As an autonomous college, our faculty corrected the papers, and the pass percentage was 80-90%.",
              "Other": "I chose this course because I'm interested in software engineering, and it pays the highest salaries. My college has a convention center where events are held, including a lot of events for Sankranthi. There is also a club called BIT Club, organized by MCA, that conducts a lot of games. B.Teach students get fee reimbursement and vasati devena for hostelers get money from the government. My college has a peaceful atmosphere because there are a lot of trees planted around it."

You have to submit your ID card details in the ICT cell. Then you get a unique ID in your email. Hostel facilities are not so good. There is a cleaning issue so much. In the 1st year, you get a sharing room with two people. After that, in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th year, you get a single room for every student. In that room, you have a Bed, table and a chair. You carry your own light and fan for your room.",

Our syllabus is very old and not sufficient for industry readiness. It is only suitable for college exams, not real-life projects. Our semester exams are not very hard; they are of median level."

              "Infrastructure": "The infrastructure of the college is very poor. Although the building looks good from the outside, there is only a single building in the name of infrastructure. In some classrooms, the AC is not working. The Wi-Fi is available in the college, but it is off for 5-6 days a month. The library is very small. The SRK hostel, given to B.Tech students, is the worst hostel of Allahabad University. The quality of food is okay.",

Only a few are very good, but most just read from the book during lectures without knowing how to teach. The course curriculum is relevant for GATE preparation but lacks in terms of placement. The semester exams are easy, but the evaluation process is very tough."

We can say that around 40% were placed in my course. The highest package: 13 lacs in HCL, the lowest package: 3–4 lacs from Infosys-like companies. Average package: around 8.5 lacs through the data provided by my JK Institute placement cell. Top recruiting companies like: HCL, TCS, INFOSYS, Indiamart, Morgan Stanley, Microsoft, DRDO Labs, ForceBolt, and Emphasis. Internships: Aside from placement, students are also selected for various student-oriented programs like Google Summer of Code (GSOC), Google Develops Student Club (GDSC), Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Engage, etc. Campus placements are offered for students graduating with B.Tech, M.Tech, and also promote higher studies in the same institute as well. Our college is best known for securing double-digit ranks in the GATE exam. In GATE 2024, HRITHIK ROSHAN, our 4th-year senior, got AIR 98 in GATE EXAMINATION 2024.",

Classrooms are fully air-conditioned with a 100+ student capacity. Our college has a computer lab with high-end computers and a high-speed internet connection. Our college also has a Wi-Fi connection with 100 Mbps speed. Library with 10,000 books and journals. Hostel Mess is quite good and provides food at cheap rates. For one month, it is around 2500 rupees per month. Medical facilities are also available, like a proper hospital for college students. Sports like basketball, volleyball, cricket, football, hockey, and kabaddi are available.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are qualified and knowledgeable, but their way of teaching is not good; they know the content but don't know how to convey the message to the student, but they are helpful in projects and all. Our course is totally based on the GATE exam syllabus, and for getting placements, our syllabus makes students industry-ready for off-campus purposes. Semester exams are not that difficult; there are two types of exams held per semester, like mid-semester and end-semester, and hence the semester is finished. Mid-semester exam of 20 marks and have to get 40% marks to get passed. The same goes with the end-of-semester exams; they are 60 marks, and we have to get 40% marks to get passed.",
              "Other": "I have an interest in electronics from the 10th standard, so I chose this course. In the future, I have to go for higher studies, so in the GATE exam, electronics students are very few, which results in getting a good rank at low marks as well. Electronics is the future for India. Lab quality should improve in our institution, as should good professor recruitment. Events like: BBL-cricket tournament, sweat, football, AVIRBHAV: cultural festival. Campus crowd: 300+. Connectivity is very good, with a railway station only 6-7 kilometers away. The campus surrounding it has so many trees and no traffic sound. Scholarships like the UP scholarship, etc."

Around 35-40 students seats for placement and among them,  13 students get on-campus placement and 7-8 students get off-campus placement.

The average Package is around 8LPA\nIt's a good average but where the other students are of that batch? - Lots of students score very well in GATE (AIR 17, AIR 160, AIR 260, etc.). And doing M.Tech from IIT and NIT. - Some of them get into IIM for MBA through CAT\n- And others are just preparing for UPSC (UP, Bihar Students are mad in the name of government job)\nIn-short: 50% Placed + 30% doing M.Tech from IIT/NIT + 5% doing MBA + 10% Preparing for government Job + 5% are doing baap ka Business\nBut It's sure if you want a job and does some coding after 4 years surely you will get a good job.",

Talking about overall placement, it is also great and one of the best in Maharashtra, after IIT Bombay, so you can consider admission with placement in mind.",
              "Infrastructure": "The hostel is average. The PG hostel is top-notch, but not everyone gets that. The other hostels are around average, but they are affordable and budget-friendly, with fees around Rs. 22,000 for a normal hostel and Rs. 44,000 for a PG hostel. The food is below average.",
              "Faculty": "The exams are tougher in this college compared to other colleges, as the syllabus is deeper than in other colleges. For passing, a minimum of 35-40 marks are required. Regarding course relevancy, it is about 70-30. Some subjects are relevant, while others are not.",

              "Placements": "I am from the B.Tech Electrical Engineering (2023–27 batch). In my course, around 70–75% of students got placed in the previous batch. The highest package was around 12 LPA, the average was around 4.5 LPA, and the lowest was around 2.5 LPA. Top recruiters included TCS, Infosys, Wipro, L&T, and a few core companies like Siemens. About 60% of students also got internships in companies such as Tata Power and Bosch. The top roles offered were graduate engineer trainee, software engineer, and junior design engineer.",
              "Infrastructure": "The college has well-maintained classrooms, projectors, and good Wi-Fi in labs and the library. Labs are updated with the equipment needed for electrical engineering experiments. The library is big with digital access, too. Hostel rooms are decent with proper ventilation, water supply, and 24/7 security. The mess food is average but hygienic. Sports facilities like cricket and football grounds, badminton, and indoor games are available. Medical facilities are also provided on campus.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are well-qualified, many with PhDs and research backgrounds. They are helpful and encourage practical learning. The curriculum is updated and industry-oriented, especially with subjects related to EVs and renewable energy. Semester exams are moderate in difficulty; if you attend classes regularly and prepare, you can easily pass. The pass percentage is usually above 80–85%.",
              "Other": "I chose electrical engineering because of my interest in electric vehicles. The best part is the practical exposure and industry talks arranged by the department. I hope the college adds more core company placements and improves hostel food quality. Overall, the campus life, events, and scholarships make the journey rewarding."

Highest package offered in recent years has been around 8 to 10 LPA, with the average salary lying in the range of four to five, with the lowest package around 2.5 LPA.

The best part about the course is balance between theory and practical experience, students get to work with well-equipped facts and games, hands-on screening that directly commits to industry practice."

Once the placement season starts in August, companies offering really good packages keep coming until the end of July. If you are good at what you like and what the companies demand, you are sure to get a job.",
              "Infrastructure": "Being a government institute, there is not much you can expect. The funds are not used where they should be. Most of the funds are used to pay the salaries of the contractual faculty. However, there are a few world-class laboratories where quality work is done. Most of these labs are industry-backed and are supported well by the institute.",
              "Faculty": "There are a lot of opportunities students get in various forms. The exam schedules are such that students get enough time between semesters to do some extra things. Most of the students prefer doing an internship, with a few getting them on campus as well. There is more focus on independent study."

The minimum would be 6 LPA, but it could scale up to 13-20 LPA for companies like Tata, Infosys, etc. Currently, we are all interns at companies like Central Railway, BEST, Accord Electro Technics, TIFR, etc. The top roles offered are representative, event manager, and club representative.",
              "Infrastructure": "All classrooms and some sitting areas have Wi-Fi, and the network strength is very good. The library also has Wi-Fi, and it's vast—you can find any book you want from diploma to degree level. The sitting area is large and appears quite premium, I guess. The hostel is also very good and clean. The mess offers tasty meals, and the rooms are quite nice. For sports and games, the hostel ground is very large and well-maintained. We also have a gymkhana offering games like carrom, chess, and table tennis.",
              "Faculty": "The staff is very friendly and helpful, and all of them are experts in their fields. So, the lectures are easy to understand as long as you stay attentive. The curriculum is well balanced, providing good theoretical and practical experience, preparing us for the industry. Plus, we are required to do a two-month internship, which gives us even more practical and on-field knowledge.",
              "Other": "I opted for this course because I was genuinely interested in electronics as a field and subject. The best part is that we are taught essential computer languages. To be honest, nothing else comes to mind. Events are quite lively—they are managed by students from the cultural clubs and are very energetic. The campus crowd is super helpful and friendly, especially if you are new and need assistance. The campus itself looks quite historic because of how old the college is. You can get a bunch of scholarships based on your score, and extracurricular activities are good."

A maximum of students get placements. To get placements, students should have a pointer above 7.5 so that students can give interviews with companies. Students get placed but only on their average score. They provide internships in good companies and help us to get the best for their future job. We don't have to attend the college in 3rd year if we manage to get an internship.",
              "Infrastructure": "The college is the topmost college. It has a nice campus and nice teachers. There is a good positive vibe for students. It is a government college, so it has its own hostel and mess. The fee for the hostel is Rs. 12,000 for a year with mess and that is much less according to other hostels in Mumbai.",
              "Faculty": "It is better than any other college. It is innovative and flexible. Some of the old faculty members have real wisdom and go very deep into the subject. They don't believe in finishing the syllabus but whatever they teach is taught in full depth. Innovative assignments aligned with the teaching make us use that knowledge and practice. The exam structure is simple. We have an MS semester test for 40 marks, which is converted to 20 marks, and the end-semester test is for 100 marks which are converted to 60 marks, and the remaining 20 marks are given on assignments. The course is well-updated. The faculty members are very friendly and ready for any difficulties faced by the students to solve them. They give proper guidance to students. The course syllabus is properly balanced during the semester."

              "Placements": "The placements of VJTI go neck to neck with most of the NITs and a few IITs. It is the factor that attracts most of the students. Computer Engineering provides an average package of 20 LPA. On the other hand, branches like IT, EXTC, and Electronics provide an average package of 15, 13, and 12 LPA, respectively. The top recruiting companies are: Deloitte, Morgan Stanley, Amazon, ICICI Bank, etc. The highest package in 2024 was 57 LPA. The lowest placement is generally between 6-12 LPA. The highest internship stipend was 5.9L. There were 400+ internship offers. There were 27+ selections in Google.",
              "Infrastructure": "Since the college is over 100 years old, the infrastructure is not a strong point of the college, with CS, Textile, and IT departments being an exception. Yes, VJTI does provide hostel facilities for students, although not all students get the hostels. In other words, rooms are given on the basis of the merit list of the competitive exam during the time of admission. There are 2 hostels for B.Tech and Diploma, for both boys and girls. In addition, there is 1 hostel for M.Tech students. The M.Tech hostels are amazing, with facilities like geysers, cleaner washrooms, balconies, and lifts.",
              "Faculty": "Most of the faculty is good enough, but you will face some problems with a few facilities. This is true for every branch in the college. Most of the teachers provide useful notes and are very experienced. The HOD is very interactive with the students. They listen to and resolve the issues accordingly.",
              "Other": "I chose VJTI since it is the best college you can get through MHT CET. Events, fests, and the campus crowd are the best parts of the college."

You cannot expect more from the infrastructure, as the buildings are old, but the college has all the necessary labs and clubs. VJTI also has a committee called SRA (Society of Robotics and Automation) where people who are interested in robotics and related fields can join and try it. VJTI has 2 main grounds, a volleyball court, a basketball court, and a gymkhana where you can hang out with your friends and play games like carrom, TT, chess, etc. in your free time. It also has a canteen in the college where you can chill with friends.",

There are enough screens and a projector set up for e-learning also.",

Raheja, Technimont, etc. The highest package in our course was 14 LPA and the average package was 5 LPA. Considering the students who sat for placements, the placement percentage was roughly around 80-85 percent. It’s compulsory to do an internship of at least 6 weeks in the summer break of our third year. Various internship offers are available from our faculty members in companies like CIDCO, Coastal Roads Project, KPM Engineering, etc. as a site executive. However, these internship offers are unpaid. For paid internship offers, you can try for off-campus opportunities.",
              "Infrastructure": "As the college is one of the oldest colleges in Maharashtra, the infrastructure is not to the point. However, multiple renovation works have started in the college to improve the infrastructure. The classrooms are huge and air-conditioned with modern technological equipment like Samsung screens and projectors. The hostels are very clean and spacious. These hostels are very affordable; however, they have quite limited seats.",
              "Faculty": "The college is autonomous and the curriculum is up-to-date. The teachers are very friendly and helpful. They are always available when you have any doubt or issue. The semester exams are a bit easier as the faculty members set the paper themselves, so we are well-acquainted with the syllabus. There are hardly 2-3 students in a batch who fail in a subject. The cases of year drops are very low.",
              "Other": "VJTI is one of the most reputed colleges. The curriculum VJTI had for my course is comparatively better than other colleges. The best part about our course was we were given a chance to carry out the work practically by visiting sites, etc. One thing I would like to change about this course is the strict attendance nature, which was not much seen in other courses of our college."

Some of the best things about this course are the spectrum of learning, its application, which is quite wide and its scope in real-world applications.

The highest salary package offered was 4.1 LPA for the course of B.Sc biotechnology. The lowest salary package offered was 2 LPA. Top recruiters here were Life Cell, Zifo RnD, etc. Internships were not provided by our college, except for a few summer training sessions for which they collected the fee from students. Top roles offered by companies through placements were associate analyst and COVID lab technician.",
              "Infrastructure": "The infrastructure of the department is amazing, with spacious classrooms, well-equipped laboratories and maintained washrooms. Wi-Fi facility is good in few classrooms and very poor in few classrooms. The laboratories have good quality equipment like chambers, HPLC, spectrophotometer, colorimeter, etc., from reputed brands like Eppendorf, Shimadzu and many more. There is one main canteen on the campus and 2 small canteens. One Amul parlour is also available here, and medical facilities are not up to the mark. Sports like cricket, football, basketball, badminton, handball, etc., are played with ample sports equipment and fields/courts available here. The hostel is huge and has good facilities. Boys and girls hostels are separated by a huge distance. There are different types of rooms such as 2 sharing, 3 sharing and single sharing rooms. Only the single rooms have air-conditioners. The food and water facilities are provided. For Muslims, suhoor and iftar are also provided in the mess during the month of Ramadan. Laundry and Wi-Fi facilities are available in the hostel, whose charges are included in the fee.",
              "Faculty": "The real supporters throughout 3 years of the course are professors. They are truly qualified, knowledgeable, approachable and motivated in all aspects. All professors have completed their PhD and post-doctoral from reputed institutions in India and abroad. They don't compromise in terms of teaching. The course curriculum is well-designed to clear the basic and applied level of concepts in biotechnology. But it doesn't make students industry-ready because biotechnology is a vast domain and a bachelor degree in biotechnology is not sufficient to have a good grip on the subject. Opting for M.Sc would be a wise choice to be industry-ready. Semester exams are easy to crack, and their difficulty level is low. Exams are conducted in 2 assessments and one end semester exam pattern every semester, along with weightage of internals and practicals. The pass percentage is 40%.",
              "Other": "This course is very undervalued in our nation. RnD is a field that can change the entire nation and has the potential for tremendous development. This field enriches students with knowledge and growth. It does not benefit just students but also benefits the entire world through breakthrough research. I wish we were provided with more hands-on training like internships and industrial visits. Our university organises vivid cultural events and fests every semester to celebrate festivals, talents and many more. Extracurricular activities like dance, literature, music, sports, drama, Silambam, fashion, etc., are conducted through the official groups. The crowd is huge, but since the campus is huge, it doesn't cause any difficulty. The campus is surrounded by greenery everywhere and has the Vandalur zoo right next to the university. The connectivity is good through public buses and trains. Both the institute and government provide scholarships to B.Tech. For students who excel in academics, the fee is already minimal, but it is not provided to B.Sc students."

The hostel and mess are decent. The buildings are well developed. But due to a lack of space, it's not easy to enjoy any event. It's okay, not too good, not too bad, but manageable. Just don't expect to have an elite feeling, hoping BMS College of Engineering is a top-tier 1 college. It's infrastructure is pretty decent.",
              "Faculty": "The emphasis is more on studying than skills, it's a fact. I don't like the 85 percent attendance criteria. The faculty helps you get good marks if you interact with them and regularly ask questions. Don't expect that you will be taught real-world skills. It's just the VTU-affiliated curriculum. If you like to just study, then this is for you, but if you prefer skills, then this is not helpful. Also, the curriculum is highly outdated."

It lacks extracurriculars. No major events like freshers or festivals are organized by the college, though hostelers enjoy more freedom and conduct their own. Sports facilities are limited with only a football turf, basketball, volleyball and table tennis courts, no badminton or a proper cricket ground. The huge parking lot can be better utilized for sports or another building. Overall CMRIT is excellent academically but falls short in sports, events and non academic experiences."

The roles offered are data analysis, web development, and full-stack developer.",

Classrooms are well-maintained, and the library is also good, with a collection of books; more than 5000 books are available. Labs are well-maintained, and Wi-Fi is also available for each floor and block. I do not live at the hostel, so I don't know about it.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are very helpful and humble. All teachers are well-qualified and knowledgeable, and the teaching quality is superb. Course curriculum relevance is more important for us. It makes students industry-ready. Semester exams are difficult because they make question papers at a moderate level, so students face them. The passing percentage is 40, so you can easily qualify if you study daily.",

The infrastructure is good and well-maintained with regular cleaning and proper hygiene. Departments are fully equipped with safety devices and decent classrooms with a capacity of 60-70 students. The library is also good with over 6,000 books. Medical facilities are average, with a dispensary where only a few medicines are available. Sports are managed by the Champion Club under the guidance of DSW (Student Welfare). DSW is the best thing I found in the college as they are always available and help students in all situations. Hostel food is average, and we just eat to live.",
              "Faculty": "Most teachers are good and cooperative, but a few are not of that type. Most of the teachers complete the syllabus on time, but those who are not able to complete it take extra classes. Teachers have good knowledge. Yes, the curriculum is relevant, and it is decided by PTU Jalandhar. However, I don't think they make students industry-ready; students themselves have to pay a lot of attention to enhance skills. Semester examinations are not very tough, but sometimes mass reappearances occur. The pass percentage is 80-90%.",
              "Other": "I like the course as it is innovation-based, so it can lead to good startups. The physics and chemistry in the 1st semester must be removed, and some skill-based subjects should be taught, as we have only 4 years to acquire all the necessary skills, and 1 year is wasted on physics and chemistry. Fests and events occur regularly. During admission time, the major fest \"Parivartan\" occurs once a year and is paid. The college pays attention to extracurricular activities, which are managed by DSW."

The highest package is around 59 LPA, and the average is around 11 LPA for CSE.",
              "Infrastructure": "The hostel is not so good and not so bad, something similar to normal junior colleges with fewer restrictions. Food quality is okay and quite manageable. There is also a bus facility for hostelers during lunch to go and come back to the college. There is a good amount of security in the hostel, and there is no encouragement of ragging as well.",
              "Faculty": "Faculty is okay, and the curriculum is similar to any other top colleges in EAMCET, which does not make us fully industry-ready, but we can still gain some core skills and knowledge. There will be two mids conducted per semester and a Sem End Examination. Marks are divided into internal and external for both labs and theory. Maintaining a decent CGPA is enough."

              "Faculty": "Faculty members are really helpful for students in teaching the concepts clearly. They are highly recommended for students because they are highly qualified and well-experienced in their course. The course curriculum is really giving amazing results in making many students ready for the industry. Semester exams are mostly good enough to pass, so the pass percentage is 80%.",
              "Other": "This course excited me very much, because it is an evergreen course, so I chose this course. Things like providing the best equipment in the laboratory will be great. Many refreshment zone activities like games, festivals, events, fests, farewells, freshers, crowd meetings, tours, concerts, etc., are conducted as per the academic calendar. It also has NCC."

Semester exams are not so difficult. An average student who attends all the classes can easily pass exams. The pass percentage is 85%.",

My college helped me explore more about this course through its real-world projects and labs. Events and fests happen once a year, which is sad, but there are extracurricular activities like cricket tournaments and dance contests, which are held often. The campus surroundings are peaceful. There is a good environment for students to study. Once we enter the college, we cannot go out. Strict rules are followed here."

I am interested in Political Science, which is why I chose B.A. Hons for my graduation. Best thing about this course is that it provides a foundation for my future preparation for civil services. I wish the government would increase funding for social sciences and make the classes more technically advanced. DEI organizes its biggest fest on December 31 and the campus is spacious. DEI also allocates many scholarships to students and we are engaged in many other activities."

The hostel is way too expensive, and many students prefer PGs nearby rather than living in the hostel.",

Mass recruiters like Cognizant and many more are coming for placements and take the students in quantity, like 150-200 students.",

Department provides access to project labs and seminar halls for presentations. Hostel facilities are decent with clean rooms and common areas. Mess food quality is satisfactory and hygienic, though canteen options are better. Medical facilities are available on campus, and sports facilities include cricket, football, basketball courts, and indoor games. Overall, both academic and hostel infrastructure support a balanced student's life.",
              "Faculty": "Faculty members are knowledgeable, approachable, and supportive. Most of them hold advanced degrees and provide guidance beyond academics, encouraging project-based learning. Teaching quality is good with a mixture of theory and practical exposure. The curriculum is designed to be industry relevant, especially with subjects in AI, data science, and machine learning, but it could include more updated electives aligned with current trends. Semester exams are of moderate difficulty and test both conceptual clarity and application. With regular study and project work, students perform well. The pass percentage generally remains high, around 85-90%.",
              "Other": "I chose the artificial intelligence and data science course because of my strong interest in emerging technologies like AI, ML, and data analytics. The best part of the course is that it relevance to the current industry and the practical learning opportunities through projects and hackathons. I wish the curriculum included more industry-driven electives and real-world case studies."
